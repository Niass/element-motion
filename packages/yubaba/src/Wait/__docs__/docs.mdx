# Wait

Is used to pause the execution of all child animations until all parent children animations have completed.
Add it between two animations for the deeper descendant animation to start only after the previous one has finished.

## Usage

```js
import Baba, { Wait, Move, CircleExpand } from 'yubaba';

export const AnimatedListItem = ({ id, children }) => (
  <Baba name={`list-item-${id}`}>
    <CircleExpand background="red">
      <Wait>
        <Move>{baba => <li {...baba}>{children}</li>}</Move>
      </Wait>
    </CircleExpand>
  </Baba>
);
```
