# Animator

You will use this component with most animations.
It does a few things:

- take snapshots of the DOM
- pass data to the animations
- execute and orchestrate the animations

You'll really only need to be concerned with _execute and orchestrate the animations_.
There are three ways you can execute animations,
listed below.

> **Tip -** Missing some context? Have a look at [Getting started](/getting-started) first.

## Animate unmounted to mounted

You'll find this is the goto way for triggering animations.
It will animate between an element that unmounts and an element that mounts over a state change.
[Moving to another element](/getting-started#moving-to-another-element) is a good example of this.

```js
import Animator, { Move } from 'yubaba';

({ isShown }) => [
  !isShown && (
    <Animator name="default">
      <Move>{children}</Move>
    </Animator>
  ),
  isShown && (
    <Animator name="default">
      <Move>{children}</Move>
    </Animator>
  ),
];
```

## Animate self

Using the `triggerSelfKey` prop to force an animation on itself over a state change.
[Moving to the same element](/getting-started#moving-to-the-same-element) is a good example of this.

```js
import Animator, { Move } from 'yubaba';

({ children, itemId }) => (
  <Animator triggerSelfKey={itemId} name="self-target">
    <Move>{children}</Move>
  </Animator>
);
```

> **Tip -** You can't use this with the `in` prop,
> if you try you'll get a dev error.

## Animate persisted to mounted

Animate between a react element that never unmounts and one that mounts/unmounts over a state change.
Using the `in` prop to mark a persisted component if it is considered in or not.
[Moving from a persisted element](/getting-started#moving-from-a-persisted-element) is a good example of this.

```js
import Animator, { Move } from 'yubaba';

({ isShown }) => [
  <Animator name="default" in={!isShown}>
    <Move>{children}</Move>
  </Animator>,
  isShown && (
    <Animator name="default">
      <Move>{children}</Move>
    </Animator>
  ),
];
```

> **Tip -** You can also use the same method to animate over unmounted to persisted.

## Props

<Props of={Animator} />
