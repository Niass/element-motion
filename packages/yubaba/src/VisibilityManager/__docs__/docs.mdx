# VisibilityManager

Used to hide contents before an animation is complete after being triggered from a child [Baba](/baba) component.
If there is more than one child [Baba](/baba) you can use an optional name prop which should match the appropriate [Baba](/baba) component.

If it is the initial mount it will be shown **after** its child animation has finished unless you set `isInitiallyVisible`.

> **Tip -** See [Delay showing content until all animations have finished](/advanced-usage#delay-showing-content-until-all-animations-have-finished) for more information on how to use this component.

## Usage

```js
import Baba, { VisibilityManager } from 'yubaba';

const ItemDetails = ({ description }) => (
  <VisibilityManager>
    {({ style }) => (
      <React.Fragment>
        <Baba name={`item-${index}`}>{props => <div {...props} />}</Baba>

        <div style={style}>{description}</div>
      </React.Fragment>
    )}
  </VisibilityManager>
);
```

> **Tip -** We used `visibility` over `opacity` because it allows us to have fine grained control for hiding elements.
> You can hide the container around an animating element and the animating element will still be visible for example.

## Props

<PropsTable of={VisibilityManager} />
