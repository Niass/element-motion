## What is yubaba???

It's all about **animation** 🧙✨ - it can help with:

- 📴 Enabling animations to be possible between disconnected leaf nodes in the React tree
- 🚚 [Moving an element](/move) from one location to another
- 💨 [Revealing elements](/focal-reveal-move) inside another element
- 👓 [Supporting animations](/supporting-animations) by obstructing elements in view
- 🤫 [Hiding children elements](/advanced-usage#delay-showing-content-until-all-animations-have-finished) until animations have completed to trick users
- 🔢 [Orchestrating](/advanced-usage#wait-for-the-previous-animation-to-finish-before-starting-the-next) when animations should start and [in what order](/advanced-usage#controlling-in-what-order-animations-should-execute)
- 📝 Composing animations together to create composite animations, for example [CrossFadeMove](/cross-fade-move)
- 🤯 [Anything you can imagine](/custom-animations), seriously

## Installation

`yubaba` has a peer dependency on [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for some of the more advanced animations.

```bash
npm install yubaba react@^16.4.x react-dom@^16.4.x emotion@^10.x.x --save
```

or

```bash
yarn add yubaba react@^16.4.x react-dom@^16.4.x emotion@^10.x.x
```

> **Tip -** Both es and commonjs modules are provided in the package.
> Make sure to consume the es modules for their tree shaking ability!

## Usage

```js
import Animator, { Move } from 'yubaba';

({ isLarge }) => (
  <Animator triggerSelfKey={isLarge}>
    <Move>{anim => <div {...anim} className={isLarge ? 'large' : 'small'} />}</Move>
  </Animator>
);
```
