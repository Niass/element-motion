# ReshapingContainer

A composite component that is made up of the [Move](/move) animation and some extra markup for the floating background.
It has been made to be able to efficiently have the parent container resize around its children after state changes.

This is useful for anything where you want the background to nicely reshape itself around its children,
for example a hover menu!

> **Tip -** When we say _efficiently_ we mean it ğŸ™Œ! _Only_ `transform` is utilised.

## Usage

```js
import { ReshapingContainer } from 'yubaba';
```

<Playground>
  <TripeHoverMenu />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={ReshapingContainer} />
