# What are focal animations?

The bread and butter of `element motion` üçû.

Focal animations are all about a single focal element that we want to transition from one state to another.
While multiple elements _may_ be utilised in a focal animation (e.g. how [FocalRevealMove](/focal-reveal-move) works),
the animations are always interested in a single focal element.
