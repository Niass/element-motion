# ReshapingContainer

A composite experience that is made up of the [Move](/move) motion and some extra markup for the floating background.
It has been made to be able to efficiently have the parent container resize around its children after state changes.

This is useful for anything where you want the background to nicely reshape itself around its children,
for example a hover menu!

> **Tip -** When we say _efficiently_ we mean it ğŸ™Œ! _Only_ `transform` is utilised.

## Usage

<Playground>
  <TripeHoverMenu />
</Playground>

```js
import { ReshapingContainer } from '@element-motion/core';

({ children }) => (
  <ReshapingContainer
    triggerKey={children}
    boxShadow="0 50px 100px -20px rgba(50,50,93,.25), 0 30px 60px -30px rgba(0,0,0,.3), 0 -18px 60px -10px rgba(0,0,0,.025)"
    background="#fff"
    maxWidth="500px"
    borderRadius="3px"
    padding="16px"
  >
    {motion => <Styled.Menu {...motion}>{children}</Styled.Menu>}
  </ReshapingContainer>
);
```

## Props

<Props of={ReshapingContainer} />
