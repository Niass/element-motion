# Reveal

Will reveal the destination element from the origin size to the destination size using `clip-path` only which will not work for IE11.

## Usage

```js
import { Reveal } from '@element-motion/core';
```

## Props

<Props of={Reveal} />

## Gotchas

### Collapsing margins

Be careful of collapsing margins when utilising this motion,
they will make the destination element jump around,
probably.
If you're seeing some odd behavior - maybe try a flex container instead.

### Composing with move

When composing with any motion that uses `transform` or `position: relative`,
Reveal will not work in Safari - follow the bug here: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196731.
